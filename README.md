Tumor Detection using Neural Networks

This repository contains code for a neural network model designed to detect tumors based on features extracted from medical images. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset includes various metrics related to tumor characteristics.

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including standardization of features and label encoding.
Model Architecture: A sequential neural network is defined with multiple dense layers and a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
Training: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss for a specified number of epochs.
Evaluation: Model predictions are evaluated on a test set, and a sample of predictions is printed alongside true labels.
Feel free to explore the code for a deeper understanding of the implementation and contribute to the project!
